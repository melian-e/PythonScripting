The author methodically covers all the language features of TS from bottom to top, with a really dense signal-to-noise ratio on almost every page (the occasional slightly-too-long geek-humor aside notwithstanding).IF you are NOT already senior in both ES6 and a typed language, I wouldn't start with this book. Why not? I say that because the author's writing style is very much targeted at those who already know all the vocabulary, and the usage/value/purpose, of most features he explains along the way. This is NOT a book that will teach you what these features are if you don’t already know. He gives plenty of really good code examples, but as those features get more advanced you may struggle if you don’t already have an understanding of the general meaning/purpose/value of those features. It's a book that assumes you know _a_few_ other typed languages already, and you just want to learn how to do the things you're already familiar with, using TypeScript.While I _am_ very experienced with JS/ES6, and I _have_ worked with typed languages before, I'll admit I'm new to generic types (i.e. these guys… <T>, <T, U>, etc.).  I learned from this book that these are central to TS, and that they're a super powerful abstraction feature. But honestly, I'm still super confused about how they work, how I'll properly use them, etc.This book didn't quite get me there with “generics”, so I need to do some more reading (and hacking) to figure that all out.  Since this is my first TS book, that's fine – but while generics are the only thing I had real trouble with, unless you're experienced with types in general there may a few other things that leave you confused after reading this book.Final word: This is a GREAT BOOK - but it’s NOT for beginners. If you’re not a ninja already, learn ES6 and TS basics elsewhere first, then come to this book when you’re ready for that one permanent reference book to keep on your desk until TypeScript goes out of style.

Commenté aux États-Unis le 7 juin 2023Achat vérifié As I am transitioning from being an Engineer to a Solutions Architect, I found this book at the recommendation of one of my colleagues. It has truly opened up my mind to be able to provide real life solutions to the business and ensure that what we build is sound and resilient. As I read each chapter it unlocks new ideas and things I didn’t consider previously as an implementer. Good read for anyone starting down this path!

Smith5,0 sur 5 étoiles Excellent coverage of a very broad topic Commenté aux États-Unis le 14 avril 2022Achat vérifié This book attempts to cover what is a very broad topic, that of solutions architecture, in a way that is concise enough to cover the basics - but in enough depth to still be useful.Realistically some of the areas will be of less value over time (e.g. any specifics around AWS), but there are many areas of this book that are extremely valuable regardless of anything in technology as time passes. In fact, some of the most useful parts are those that are technology agnostic, or not related to technology at all.The section relating to soft skills may be one of those most high value sections, yet overlooked by many at the end - but in reality, the hardest skill to develop.If you are looking for a cookbook to resolve some issue, this is not it - and that is good. This book, if read carefully, is hugely valuable and speaks to methodologies that should prove useful as the industry evolves - as long as this type of role continues to exist. It explains approaches and ways of thinking that are the long term value prospect here.

As a practicing solutions architect, I found that this book has a wealth of information for those not only looking for adding brushstrokes of information to their own field of knowledge, but it also provides a considerable amount of detail on other fields such as machine learning and IoT.With easily relatable language, the picture created in this book is not only accessible but detailed, and the comprehensive explanation of various cross-sections of solutions architecture is a very powerful aspect that I cannot underscore enough, because there are nuances to this field that are often overlooked or lost by the casual practitioner. This book is holistic in its approach to the various methodologies for solutions architecture, and it makes a point to use multiple vectors to approach problems faced in the field.The author takes care to guide the reader through the journey of solution architecture, and I found this book insightful and not only worth the read, but worth a place on the bookshelf.

There are at least two ways to ‘consume’ this book.For the expert in ML, this is a textbook to study as a clear comprehensive ML overview and then to dive into sections of interest or ignorance. The concepts are grounded in code examples and are well cited (with links) to sources. Further, this textbook is appropriate if you are TensorFlow-centric and want to broaden into cutting-edge ML models/tools coded in PyTorch.For a new learner to ML, this is a textbook to DO (not just READ) with hands-on and brain-engaged. If you realize that ML is a key life-long skill for your career, consider this textbook as part of a daily learning habit (10-30 min).From personal experience, my advice to the new learner is as follows… First, clone the GitHub repository, setup your Python environment, and study the textbook, while working through the notebooks. Go on tangents and break the code. Do this methodically as part of your daily learning habit, but do not hesitate to jump ahead several chapters to prepare for tomorrow’s meeting. There is enough excellent material here for a full year of ML adventures.I did a similar strategy with Raschka’s first textbook. About four years ago, I had finished Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization as a student in his first cohort. I knew the concepts well but could not do the actual application coding. I was surprised how my Python coding improved by following Raschka’s clean and elegant style. And Raschka’s code examples were meaty enough to be springboards into working applications.Several textbook editions later, what is different about this new edition?First, it moves you through scikit-Learn (a firm foundation) to PyTorch, instead of TensorFlow. PyTorch is a better stepping-stone, both conceptually and practically. With PyTorch, you will go further with less energy, while being able to convert your efforts into TensorFlow as needed. In addition, most of the cutting-edge ML/AI/DL research is in PyTorch. It is nice to read a recent arXiv paper, clone their repository, click on the  Colab tutorial, and replicate their experiments, along with picking up a ton of new coding tricks & tips. I am excited to work through these PyTorch sections to hone my skills.Second, there is a clear recognition of model tracking and tuning practices. This is often a gap in other ML textbooks and courses. Once you progress beyond the simple demo examples in a lecture, you realize that the real work is experiments, more experiments, and still more experiments, so that you must understand what the model architecture and hyperparameters are doing to your dataset. There is good coverage of scikit-Learn pipeline, grid search, model performance, and the like.Third, ML/AI/DL practice is rapidly evolving. Every week new ML packages/services become available that could save much grief on your current project. What is refreshing about Raschka’s textbook series is that he constantly adding cutting-edge topics because he likes to stay current and to help us stay current. Hence, this edition contains recent ML treats as: transformers, self-supervised learning, autoencoders-to-GAN, graph neural networks, DBSCAN, t-SNE (with brief mention of UMAP), and PyTorch-Lightning.

As a musician all my life, I wanted to be able to get a fundamental understanding about what goes on under the hood when computers process audio signals, and hopefully start writing my own programs that do just that. In the content and coding practice realm, the book is TOP. NOTCH. You will not find a more comprehensive guide on Digital Audio Processing anywhere. In the first two chapters (being Chapter 0 and Chapter 1), there are some great techniques and strategies for really getting the most out of pointers, and, unlike most C programming books I've skimmed through, it jumps right into grabbing input for the command line, and introduces you to the proper defensive programming strategies and refactoring methods (i.e. encapsulating code into functions, using preprocessor definitions/macros, always keeping variable scope in mind) that you'll need to make strong, versatile programs. And on the audio side, it covers everything from Spectral Audio Processing to simple DSP to filter Design to effects such as Ring Modulation. And the DVD has tutorials about using C++ with either QT or Carbon to build GUIs for audio Apps, VST plug-ins, and even has a tutorial on designing an audio app for the iPhone. If you're a very advanced programmer with some signal processing background, you might find the DVD more valuable than the actual book itself.A few warnings about this book though:1) It is not, I repeat, NOT, for beginners. If you have just started learning C, or are switching over to C from a higher-level language that's not C++ or Objective-C, I HIGHLY recommend you read (or at least read the last half of) Kochan's ""Programming in C"" to get up to speed before you try to tackle this book. Chapter 1 claims to be an introduction to C , but having read through some of it to get a feel for the book's layout, I can tell you that if you do not have ample programming experience in C you will get very lost. Make especially sure that you have a thorough understanding of pointers and how they are used in all aspects of the language before diving into this book. But to be completely honest if you're a programming newbie why in the world would you want to start off learning SIGNAL PROCESSING, an advanced topic even for seasoned coders? Also, it might be important to note that you also have to have a solid understanding of sound and its basic principles, as well as some advanced composition knowledge (serial music, etc..) if you want to fully understand all the examples in the book.2) This book is a bit dated. For a number of reasons. The first is that it is absolutely pre-C99. Variables aren't declared inside of loops anywhere (even where it would be more readable and more appropriate to do so). All of the comments have the /* text */ format, even the single-line comments. Furthermore, they tell you to install Gnuplot using Aquaterm, which has been deprecated since Snow Leopard was initially released (you have to now ./configure it using X11, google ""Gnuplot in Snow Leopard"" and click on the first link for a quick tutorial on how to do so). Finally, there is a whole Chapter dedicated to writing OpCodes for CSound. Now yes, CSound was invented at MIT and this book is published by the MIT Press, and yes, it is still a widely used program, however, my personal opinion is that this could have easily gone in the DVD section and been replaced with a section on writing GUIs, VSTs, Mobile Applications, or heck even programming external objects for MaxMSP (which to my knowledge is used more often than CSound nowadays).All in all I absolutely love this book and will definitely keep it as a reference throughout my entire audio programming career; I just wish they would update it.

Commenté aux États-Unis le 25 février 2013Achat vérifié First and foremost this, book is a great resource for understanding how to program audio.  It is area is the severely lacking in the computing world, so every little bit helps.But there are some issues.1.  If you get the Kindle version you don't get the accompanying DVD data.  However, if you contact MIT Press, like I did, they are pretty good at getting you a copy of the disc for free.  And you must get the DVD, there is a lot of great information on it.2.  The book does start out on the right foot with an introduction to C.  I think this is important because I think the bulk of people interested in this book are probably Digital Audio Production guys who are Power Users but might not have done real programming.  But even if you are coming from an experienced C programmer angel I don't think it hurts.  However,  I believe it is important that the book starts off giving an introduction to C because it sets the tone for the book, and where the book should stand out.  There are no GOOD intro to audio programming books.  Most books for the audio programming are usually geared toward advanced programming or signal processing, or are so watered down the as you give a non-audio interested programer the basis to get a job done.  This is a problem, because sure you can fine plenty of intro to programming books that are happy to teach you some graphics programming along the way, but never for audio.  It is ambitious this book tries to take this route.3.  Unfortunately, the code style doesn't skill to that newbie-to-digital-audio style.First, this is an edited anthology book and it seems that every author for every section decided to do their own coding style for each section.  And not just for the code itself, but also for compiling the code [the book switches from MAKE to Scons and back and never explains why].  The problem is, as should as you understand the code from one section, you end up having to relearn everything for the next because the next author has changed the code style.  I don't understand why the authors didn't try to correct for this.  Plus the authors don't stick to proper code conventions. A good example of each of these problem is the change between chapter 5 to 6.  The code from C to C++ without any reason,  but what makes it extra annoying, is that that C++ in improperly formatted ( Example: All the headers for all the classes are in 1 file. )  It is hard to tell, if it was supposed to be poorly written C code in C++ files, or a C++ program poorly organized and written to act like C without making use of classes.Second, the code style itself, doesn't stick to simple easy to read conventions.  The authors get into a bad habit of using more advanced C/C++ tricks to write less code [highly abbreviated variable names, Ternary operations instead of true If/Else code blocks].  Sure it is good for them, bad for the learner when you are trying to learn everything step-by-step [ And for you 'advance programmers' who scoff at reading someone complaining about those things, remember you were a newbie once too]  You should NEVER write optimized code in any form when you are trying to teach something!  That is irresponsible, and disrespectful toward your students who are trying to learn.Third the end goals seem to change, as they are teaching you.  You first learn how to generate a simple realtime sound with PortAudio [the ultimate goal], but then everything become about generating a wave file for output and the reader is left pondering how to generated more then one sound at a time and keep it going.  When they do get to how to make a realtime plug-in, you aren't taught how to create a simple synthesizer, you just end up making a delay line.  Sure a delay line is important, but it doesn't teach me, how I need to manage MIDI and generate sound continuously...Anyway, if you can deal with those 3 things then you will get a lot out of this book and don't get me wrong there in this book.However, this book really needed a few more revisions to be everything it could be.  Maybe someday that will happen.

""scanf"" is deprecated and unsafe, we should be using ""scanf_s""  I was completely blocked on the first couple examples until a Google search yielded that ""scanf(""%c"", note)"" really needed a space in front of the first argument t oread instead ""scanf("" %c"", note)""  This subtle different in that space being there that book completely neglects was the different between my program compiling or not. I would expect these kinds of mistakes to have been caught somewhere in the book's editing process.It's really discouraging to be running into so many problems with the first 4 code examples of the book. I started off excited but now I'm wondering if my entire time in the book is going to be spent debugging problems with the code examples.I'm giving up for today and I just had to offer my review so far. I'll come back again soon but oof, not a promising start. This book so far is failing to live up to its high ideals for beginners, I feel like I really need to spend time to learn C, which is a real shame because this book's overview of C seemed so promising and was a selling point for me.

It explains through numerous coding examples and projects all of the major aspects of coding for audio.  It also provides cross-platform libraries you will find essential, as well as extra chapters not included in the book via the included DVD.  I was able to synthesize my own sound waves, and even write my own wav file player within a week.That said I would not recommended this book to someone who is unfamiliar with coding.  The authors do try to give an introduction to c programming, however I found that the examples in this book would be very difficult for a new programmer to be able to follow, let alone compile, given that there are many libraries which must be linked etc.  Personally though, I loved that upon opening the book for the first time I could flip through the pages gingerly and see tons and tons of straight c code.  The theory is there, but more importantly so is it's practical application, and that's what makes this book awesome.

Commenté au Royaume-Uni le 16 février 2013Achat vérifié This book is an excellent introduction to those who want to find out how to write audio software.The topics covered are really fascinating, it covers such things as the format of audio files, how to generate simple syths, to how to generate complex audio software.Truly unique, a must for serious (or seriously fanatical) audio software developers.The book does spend some time trying to explain C programming to novices. However, being a veteran C programmer, I found this an enjoyable read: the examples focus on audio programming, not just C ""Hello World"" examples.I do believe some programming concepts may be a bit tough for novices to grasp though: in which case some other introduction to C programming should also be sought, along with this excellent reference.

It has a good flow to the writing and doesn't try and bury you with too much deep knowledge as a beginner (just enough to give you the basics of the concepts being discussed). if you purchase this book there is a second book with more depth on programming provided free (on the books website github). I enjoyed this book so much I've purchased the second book for my kindle reader to support the author.I've also purchased Kaiwan's book on Linux kernel debugging which is also an excellent read; giving you a good introduction to all the different methods/tools that can be used to help you debug those stubborn issues you'll inevitably encounter working as a kernel developer.I can't wait to read the next edition of this book coming out in January; revised for the 6.x kernel. FYI, I've read this book and worked through all the examples on the latest Linux stable kernel (as of this review 6.4.x/6.5.x-rcX).You won't regret getting this book if you want to start down the path of being a Linux kernel developer! I'd love to see a book from Kaiwan on developing module/drivers using Rust (with it's support now included in Linux kernel since 6.2). :-) En lire plus  Signaler Traduire les commentaires en Français,     Marcos Rdz5,0 sur 5 étoiles Ein tolles Buch Commenté en Allemagne le 17 janvier 2023Achat vérifié Dieses Buch ist so gut geschrieben, dass man liest es wie ein Roman.

I loved the fact that code is just there to compile and load the modules (alias Mafiles and lwm script) so one can try quite fast. However, once you move forward into the book, topics get  harder and harder so it needs time to digest and hands on real issues.Although I did not went into the code details, I noticed that the author points to some chapters in the code that does not exist in the git repository, i.e.""Examples of using refcount_t within the kernel code base In one of our demo kernel modules regarding kernel threads (in ch15/kthread_simple/kthread_simple.c),....""and there are more around the book.One more thing: The author suggested to install a VM but IMO in case you just want to play with the modules (not the kernel itself where theare are built-in modules), using your bare metal linux Box is just fine so you can jump the first (long) chapters which are just about setting up either the VM or the raspberry lkm enviroment.

It has a good flow to the writing and doesn't try and bury you with too much deep knowledge as a beginner (just enough to give you the basics of the concepts being discussed). if you purchase this book there is a second book with more depth on programming provided free (on the books website github). I enjoyed this book so much I've purchased the second book for my kindle reader to support the author.I've also purchased Kaiwan's book on Linux kernel debugging which is also an excellent read; giving you a good introduction to all the different methods/tools that can be used to help you debug those stubborn issues you'll inevitably encounter working as a kernel developer.I can't wait to read the next edition of this book coming out in January; revised for the 6.x kernel. FYI, I've read this book and worked through all the examples on the latest Linux stable kernel (as of this review 6.4.x/6.5.x-rcX).You won't regret getting this book if you want to start down the path of being a Linux kernel developer! I'd love to see a book from Kaiwan on developing module/drivers using Rust (with it's support now included in Linux kernel since 6.2). :-) En lire plus  Signaler Traduire les commentaires en Français,     Marcos Rdz5,0 sur 5 étoiles Ein tolles Buch Commenté en Allemagne le 17 janvier 2023Achat vérifié Dieses Buch ist so gut geschrieben, dass man liest es wie ein Roman.

I loved the fact that code is just there to compile and load the modules (alias Mafiles and lwm script) so one can try quite fast. However, once you move forward into the book, topics get  harder and harder so it needs time to digest and hands on real issues.Although I did not went into the code details, I noticed that the author points to some chapters in the code that does not exist in the git repository, i.e.""Examples of using refcount_t within the kernel code base In one of our demo kernel modules regarding kernel threads (in ch15/kthread_simple/kthread_simple.c),....""and there are more around the book.One more thing: The author suggested to install a VM but IMO in case you just want to play with the modules (not the kernel itself where theare are built-in modules), using your bare metal linux Box is just fine so you can jump the first (long) chapters which are just about setting up either the VM or the raspberry lkm enviroment.

This multi-book set is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn or expand their skills in these fundamental areas of computer science.The standout feature of this collection is its breadth and depth of coverage. By combining five books into one, the set takes learners from the very basics of Python programming, introducing concepts like variables and loops, to more advanced topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and SQL database management. This progression allows both beginners and intermediate learners to find content that suits their needs.The books are well-structured, with clear explanations and numerous examples. Each book in the collection is logically organized, providing readers with a gradual and systematic approach to learning. The inclusion of exercises and practical examples helps reinforce the material, making it easier to grasp and retain.One of the strengths of this collection is its real-world applications. It not only covers the theoretical aspects of Python and SQL but also demonstrates how these skills are used in practical scenarios. This practicality is vital for learners who want to apply their knowledge in the workplace or in personal projects.The inclusion of SQL database management is a valuable addition. SQL is a critical skill for anyone working with data, and the book's clear explanations and hands-on exercises make it accessible even to those new to the topic.The writing style is engaging and reader-friendly, making it suitable for self-study. The books avoid overly technical jargon and offer explanations in plain language, making complex concepts easier to understand.

(Page 34)The question is: Where is this database to be found?No link is given (that I can find) in the book.No media came with the book.No mention is made (that I can find) on this amazon product page.No mention is made (that I can find) on the Mark Reed page on amazon.I can't find a link using Google search.If anyone has found a link for the data for the practice exercises, I would love to know where to find that. Otherwise, this will just be something I read once and I'll still need to take a course as well to actually learn this material.

This book explained things my professor was not going into detail about. I knew the general information about some topics but I really didn’t understand it until I read this book. It made some concepts I struggled with so much easier. I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several friends who are interested in learning to code.
